 On clicking publish, it gets put on homepage, and a brand new page is also created
for that particular post. 

On the homepage, actual blog content is truncated to 100 characters. On clicking read more,
it takes to an individual page, of each of the blog posts with full content.

Alternatively, we can go to weblink/posts/post1, where post1 is the title of a particular page,
and we get taken to that page where that post exists.
